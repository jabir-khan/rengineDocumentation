## reNgine: An automated reconnaissance framework


reNgine is An automated reconnaissance framework for web applications with focus on highly configurable streamlined recon process via Engines, recon data correlation and organization, continuous monitoring, backed by database and simple yet intuitive User Interface.

reNgine makes is easy for penetration testers to gather reconnaissance with minimal configuration and with the help of reNgine's correlation, it just makes recon effortless.

## Description

reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework with a focus on a highly configurable streamlined recon process. reNgine is backed by a database, with data correlation and organization, the custom query ‚Äúlike‚Äù language for recon data filtering, reNgine aims to address the shortcomings of traditional recon workflow. Developers behind the reNgine understand that recon data can be huge, manually looking up for entries to attack could be cumbersome, with features like Auto Interesting Subdomains discovery, reNgine automatically identifies interesting subdomains to attack based on certain keywords (both built-in and custom) and helps penetration testers focus on attack rather than recon.

reNgine is also focused on continuous monitoring. Penetration testers can choose to schedule the scan at periodic intervals, get notified on notification channels like Discord, Slack, and Telegram for any new subdomains or vulnerabilities identified, or any recon data changes.

Interoperability is something every recon tool needs, and reNgine is no different. Beginning reNgine 1.0, we additionally developed features such as import and export subdomains, endpoints, GF pattern matched endpoints, etc. This will allow you to use your favourite recon workflow in conjunction with reNgine.

reNgine features Highly configurable scan engines based on YAML, that allows penetration testers to create as many recon engines as they want of their choice, configure as they wish, and use it against any targets for the scan. These engines allow penetration testers to use tools of their choice, the configuration of their choice. Out of the box, reNgine comes with several scan engines like Full Scan, Passive Scan, Screenshot gathering, OSINT Engine, etc.

Our focus has always been on finding the right recon data with very minimal effort. While having a discussion with fellow hackers/pentesters, screenshots gallery was a must, reNgine 1.0 also comes with a screenshot gallery, and what's exciting than having a screenshot gallery with filters, filter screenshots with HTTP status, technology, ports, and services.

We also want our fellow hackers to stay ahead of the game, reNgine 1.0 introduces automatic vulnerability reporting (currently only Hackerone is supported, other platforms *may* come soon). This allows hackers to define their own vulnerability report template and reNgine will do the rest of the job to report vulnerability as soon as it is identified.
