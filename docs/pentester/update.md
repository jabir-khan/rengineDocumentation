# Updating reNgine

To update the reNgine to the latest version use the following commands:

Stop if reNgine is running

```
make stop
```

Get the latest changes, make sure you're in `master` branch.

```
git pull
```

This should pull any latest changes in reNgine from a master(stable) branch.

Since you already have certs built, you can skip building certs. The next step would be to build reNgine once again.  

```
make build
```

If no error appears, you're good to go.

```
make up
```

happy reconnaissance :-)
